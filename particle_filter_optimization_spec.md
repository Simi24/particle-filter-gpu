# CUDA Particle Filter Optimization Specification

## Overview
This document outlines advanced CUDA optimizations for the particle filter implementation, focusing on streams, warp and block unrolling, shared memory, atomic operations, and cuRAND library usage. The current implementation is already well-optimized, but several opportunities exist for further performance improvements.

## Current Implementation Analysis

### Strengths
- **Memory Coalescing**: All kernels use consecutive thread indices for coalesced global memory access
- **Warp Shuffle**: Reduction kernels use `__shfl_down_sync` for efficient warp-level reductions
- **Shared Memory**: Resampling kernel caches cumulative weights in shared memory
- **cuRAND Integration**: Proper random number generation for each particle
- **Stream Usage**: Basic stream implementation for asynchronous operations

### Areas for Improvement
- Limited stream concurrency (only one stream actively used)
- Conservative unrolling in compute kernels
- Underutilized shared memory in core kernels
- No atomic operations for parallel accumulations
- Potential for kernel fusion and memory optimizations

## Optimization Strategies

### 1. Advanced Stream Usage

#### Current State
- 4 streams allocated but only stream[0] used extensively
- Sequential execution of prediction → weight update → normalization → resampling

#### Optimizations

##### 1.1 Concurrent Kernel Execution
```cuda
// Proposed: Overlap prediction and weight computation across streams
cudaStream_t predict_stream = pf->streams[0];
cudaStream_t weight_stream = pf->streams[1];
cudaStream_t normalize_stream = pf->streams[2];
cudaStream_t resample_stream = pf->streams[3];

// Launch prediction asynchronously
predict_kernel<<<blocks, threads, 0, predict_stream>>>(...);

// While prediction runs, prepare for weight update
cudaStreamSynchronize(predict_stream); // Wait for prediction

// Launch weight update
update_weights_kernel<<<blocks, threads, 0, weight_stream>>>(...);

// Concurrent normalization and scan
inclusive_scan(..., normalize_stream);
normalize_weights_kernel<<<blocks, threads, 0, normalize_stream>>>(...);
```

##### 1.2 Memory Transfer Overlap
- Use pinned memory for all host-device transfers
- Overlap data transfers with computation using `cudaMemcpyAsync`
- Double-buffer particle arrays to hide transfer latency

##### 1.3 Multi-GPU Considerations
- For future scalability, implement stream-based multi-GPU particle distribution
- Use peer-to-peer memory access between GPUs

### 2. Warp and Block Unrolling

#### Current State
- Basic loop unrolling in reduction kernels
- Conservative unrolling to avoid register pressure

#### Optimizations

##### 2.1 Aggressive Kernel Unrolling
```cuda
// In predict_kernel: Unroll position/velocity updates
#pragma unroll 4
for (int i = 0; i < 4; ++i) {
    // Process 4 particles per thread
    int idx = blockIdx.x * blockDim.x * 4 + threadIdx.x * 4 + i;
    if (idx < n) {
        // Load particle to registers
        Particle p = particles[idx];
        // Update logic...
    }
}
```

##### 2.2 Block-Level Unrolling
- Use template metaprogramming for compile-time unrolling
- Implement block-synchronous unrolling for shared memory operations

##### 2.3 Warp-Aware Programming
```cuda
// Use warp intrinsics for conditional execution
__global__ void optimized_update_weights_kernel(...) {
    int lane = threadIdx.x % 32;
    int warp_id = threadIdx.x / 32;

    // Warp-level ballot for efficient conditionals
    unsigned mask = __ballot_sync(0xffffffff, condition);
    if (mask == 0xffffffff) {
        // All threads in warp take same path
        // Optimized computation
    }
}
```

### 3. Shared Memory Optimizations

#### Current State
- Shared memory used in resampling for cumulative weights
- Basic shared memory reductions in scan/reduce kernels

#### Optimizations

##### 3.1 Shared Memory Caching in Core Kernels
```cuda
__global__ void optimized_update_weights_kernel(
    const Particle* __restrict__ particles,
    float* __restrict__ weights,
    int n,
    float obs_x, float obs_y, float noise
) {
    __shared__ Particle s_particles[BLOCK_SIZE];
    __shared__ float s_weights[BLOCK_SIZE];

    int tid = threadIdx.x;
    int idx = blockIdx.x * blockDim.x + tid;

    // Cooperative loading to shared memory
    if (idx < n) {
        s_particles[tid] = particles[idx];
    }
    __syncthreads();

    // Compute weights using shared memory data
    if (idx < n) {
        float dx = s_particles[tid].x - obs_x;
        float dy = s_particles[tid].y - obs_y;
        float dist_sq = dx*dx + dy*dy;
        s_weights[tid] = __expf(-dist_sq / (2.0f * noise * noise));
    }
    __syncthreads();

    // Write back to global memory
    if (idx < n) {
        weights[idx] = s_weights[tid];
    }
}
```

##### 3.2 Shared Memory for Random States
- Cache cuRAND states in shared memory for faster access
- Implement shared memory random number generation pools

##### 3.3 Dynamic Shared Memory Allocation
```cuda
// Use dynamic shared memory for flexible block sizes
extern __shared__ float s_mem[];
Particle* s_particles = (Particle*)s_mem;
float* s_weights = (float*)&s_particles[blockDim.x];
```

### 4. Atomic Operations

#### Current State
- No atomic operations used (appropriate for current parallel structure)

#### Optimizations

##### 4.1 Atomic Accumulations for Statistics
```cuda
__device__ void atomic_add_float(float* addr, float val) {
    atomicAdd((unsigned int*)addr, __float_as_uint(val));
}

// In weighted_average kernel
__global__ void atomic_weighted_average_kernel(
    const Particle* particles,
    const float* weights,
    int n,
    float* sum_x,
    float* sum_y,
    float* sum_weights
) {
    // Parallel atomic accumulation
    for (int i = threadIdx.x; i < n; i += blockDim.x) {
        float w = weights[i];
        atomic_add_float(sum_x, particles[i].x * w);
        atomic_add_float(sum_y, particles[i].y * w);
        atomic_add_float(sum_weights, w);
    }
}
```

##### 4.2 Lock-Free Resampling
- Use atomic operations for parallel resampling selection
- Implement atomic counters for particle selection

##### 4.3 Performance Considerations
- Atomic operations can cause serialization - use only when beneficial
- Prefer warp-level reductions over atomics when possible

### 5. cuRAND Library Optimizations

#### Current State
- Basic cuRAND usage with one state per particle
- curand_init called once per particle

#### Optimizations

##### 5.1 Batched Random Number Generation
```cuda
// Generate random numbers in batches for better performance
__global__ void generate_noise_batch_kernel(
    curandState* rand_states,
    float* noise_buffer,
    int n_particles,
    int batch_size
) {
    int idx = blockIdx.x * blockDim.x + threadIdx.x;
    if (idx >= n_particles) return;

    curandState local_state = rand_states[idx];

    // Generate batch of random numbers
    for (int i = 0; i < batch_size; ++i) {
        noise_buffer[idx * batch_size + i] = curand_normal(&local_state);
    }

    rand_states[idx] = local_state;
}
```

##### 5.2 Optimized State Management
```cuda
// Use XORWOW generator for better performance
__global__ void init_curand_states_optimized(
    curandState* rand_states,
    int n,
    unsigned long long seed
) {
    int idx = blockIdx.x * blockDim.x + threadIdx.x;
    if (idx >= n) return;

    // Initialize with different sequences for better randomness
    curand_init(seed, idx, 0, &rand_states[idx]);
}
```

##### 5.3 cuRAND Device API Integration
